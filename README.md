## Project Structure
The project is organized into several key folders:
- `src/controllers/`: Contains route handler functions.
- `src/middlewares/`: Contains Express middleware functions.
- `src/models/`: Contains Mongoose models and schemas.
- `src/routes/`: Contains route definitions.
- `src/configs/`: Contains configuration files (e.g., database connection).
- `src/utils/`: Contains utility functions and helpers.
- `src/services/`: Contains business logic and service functions.

## Getting Started
I created this project considering that can be used as a base for new Express applications.  
To get started, clone the repository and install the dependencies:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd base-express-project
npm install
```
Otherwise you can use this template directly when creating a new repository on GitHub.  
To do so, click on **"Use this template"** button on the repository page, on the top right.
